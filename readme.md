## Credit

This plugin is originally made for my employer who awesomely agree to release this plugin as open source WordPress Plugins, [Hijapedia](http://store.hijapedia.com). A short background story: my employer gave me these HTML email designs (basically list of newly released products which will be sent to email list) to be developed. After confirming that most of the time the layout wouldn't be changed (only the banner and the product lists will be changed), I pitched him an idea to create HTML email generator which will automate this task and save lots and lots of time in the future.

Hence, this plugin is developed.
